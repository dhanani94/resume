hand -->
### <span>Sr. Analytics Engineer, Avitas a Baker Hughes Venture</span> <span>Feb 2018 -- Present</span>
− Architected and implemented a cloud computer vision system to use aerial and stationary sensor data to detect and quantify 
methane emissions, oil leaks, and other inspection items for the O&G industry. Deployed on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes 
that is configurable by customer need and resources are spun up on demand for cost-savings and maximum scalability.  
− Created efficient algorithms such as semantically fusing 2D aerial imagery detection with 3D assets in the real world using deep 
learning, multi-camera geometry, and Hungarian matching. Models were trained using state of the art algorithms using 
PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Darknet.  
− Scrum Master for the machine learning team and the computer vision team as well as liaison between the application platform 
team and the analytics team. 

### <span>Digital Technology Leadership Program, General Electric</span> <span>July 2016 -- Feb 2018</span>

− Created predictive models using support vector machines in for time series data from industrial assets to reduce unplanned 
equipment downtime months in advance. 
− Created a package to encrypt, transfer and store highly sensitive industrial data without foregoing efficiency that was 
benchmarked to be eleven times faster than the company’s previous solution.   

### <span>Software Engineer Intern, Visa </span> <span>June 2015 -- Aug 2015</span>

- Developed a full stack web application for internal atomization using Angular, Express, and DB2 for clearing and settlements.
